/*
ALGORITHMS - An algorithm is set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

    ex. Algorithm to add two numbers

    Inputs: Two numbers, a and b
    Algorithm: Add number using + sign and return the value
    Output: Sum of a and b


    Characteristics: 
        - Well-defined input and output
        - each step should clear

/*
ALGORITHM ANALYSIS

1. Time complexity - amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size
2. Space comlexity - amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

How to represent? 
    use Asymptotic notations (mathematical tools to represent time and complexity)
        1. Big O Notation - Worst Case Complexity (/)
        2. Omega Notation - Best Case Complexity
        3. Theta Notation - Average Case Complexity


    BIG O NOTATION 
        describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms
